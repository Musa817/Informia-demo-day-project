Description (50 words or less.):
We feel that being an active, educated American citizen is more important that ever. Most people aren't aware of what goes on everyday
in Congress. Informia changes that. The app informs the user of legislative actions debated and taken in Congress everyday.
Knowledge is power and Informia wants power for the people.
